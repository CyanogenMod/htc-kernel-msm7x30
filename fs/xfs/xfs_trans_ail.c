 * xfs_trans_ail_delete_bulk - remove multiple log items from the AIL
 *
 * @xfs_trans_ail_delete_bulk takes an array of log items that all need to
 * removed from the AIL. The caller is already holding the AIL lock, and done
 * all the checks necessary to ensure the items passed in via @log_items are
 * ready for deletion. This includes checking that the items are in the AIL.
 *
 * For each log item to be removed, unlink it  from the AIL, clear the IN_AIL
 * flag from the item and reset the item's lsn to 0. If we remove the first
 * item in the AIL, update the log tail to match the new minimum LSN in the
 * AIL.
 *
 * This function will not drop the AIL lock until all items are removed from
 * the AIL to minimise the amount of lock traffic on the AIL. This does not
 * greatly increase the AIL hold time, but does significantly reduce the amount
 * of traffic on the lock, especially during IO completion.
 *
 * This function must be called with the AIL lock held.  The lock is dropped
 * before returning.
