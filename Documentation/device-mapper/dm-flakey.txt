=========

This target is the same as the linear target except that it returns I/O
errors periodically.  It's been found useful in simulating failing
devices for testing purposes.

Starting from the time the table is loaded, the device is available for
<up interval> seconds, then returns errors for <down interval> seconds,
and then this cycle repeats.

Parameters: <dev path> <offset> <up interval> <down interval>
    <dev path>: Full pathname to the underlying block-device, or a
                "major:minor" device-number.
    <offset>: Starting sector within the device.
    <up interval>: Number of seconds device is available.
    <down interval>: Number of seconds device returns errors.
