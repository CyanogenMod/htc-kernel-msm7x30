	---help---
	  Say Y here if you wish to control a ENE SM/MS Card reader.
	  To use SD card, please build driver/usb/storage/ums-eneub6250.ko

	  This option depends on 'SCSI' support being enabled, but you
	  probably also need 'SCSI device support: SCSI disk support'
	  (BLK_DEV_SD) for most USB storage devices.

	  To compile this driver as a module, choose M here: the
	  module will be called keucr.
