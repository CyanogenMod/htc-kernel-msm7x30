What:		/sys/bus/iio/devices/deviceX/sampling_frequency
KernelVersion:	2.6.35
Contact:	linux-iio@vger.kernel.org
Description:
		Some devices have internal clocks.  This parameter sets the
		resulting sampling frequency.  In many devices this
		parameter has an effect on input filters etc rather than
		simply controlling when the input is sampled.  As this
		effects datardy triggers, hardware buffers and the sysfs
		direct access interfaces, it may be found in any of the
		relevant directories.  If it effects all of the above
		then it is to be found in the base device directory as here.

Description:
		Description of the scan element data storage within the buffer
		and hence the form in which it is read from user-space.
		Form is [s|u]bits/storagebits[>>shift].  s or u specifies if
		signed (2's complement) or unsigned. bits is the number of bits
		of data and storagebits is the space (after padding) that it
		occupies in the buffer. shift if specified, is the shift that
		needs to be applied prior to masking out unused bits. Some
		devices put their data in the middle of the transferred elements
		with additional information on both sides.  Note that some
		devices will have additional information in the unused bits
		so to get a clean value, the bits value must be used to mask
		the buffer output value appropriately.  The storagebits value
		also specifies the data alignment.  So s48/64>>2 will be a
		signed 48 bit integer stored in a 64 bit location aligned to
		a a64 bit boundary. To obtain the clean value, shift right 2
		and apply a mask to zero the top 16 bits of the result.
		For other storage combinations this attribute will be extended
		appropriately.

		and the relevant _type attributes to establish the data storage
		format.
