-	Test on more platforms
-	Clean up the various chunks of unused code
-	Sort out the power management side. Not important for Poulsbo but
	matters for Moorestown
-	Add Moorestown support (single pipe, no BIOS, no stolen memory,
				some other differences)
-	Sort out the bo and ttm code to support userframe buffers and DRM
	interfaces rather than just faking it enough for a framebuffer
-	Add 2D acceleration via console and DRM

As per kernel policy and the in the interest of the safety of various
kittens there is no support or plans to add hooks for the closed user space
stuff.


Why bother ?
- Proper display configuration
- Can be made to work on Moorestown where VESA won't
- Works on systems where the VESA BIOS is bust or the tables are broken
  without hacks
- 2D acceleration

Currently tested on
+	Dell Mini 10 100x600
