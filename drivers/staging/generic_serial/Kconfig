config A2232
	tristate "Commodore A2232 serial support (EXPERIMENTAL)"
	depends on EXPERIMENTAL && ZORRO && BROKEN
	---help---
	  This option supports the 2232 7-port serial card shipped with the
	  Amiga 2000 and other Zorro-bus machines, dating from 1989.  At
	  a max of 19,200 bps, the ports are served by a 6551 ACIA UART chip
	  each, plus a 8520 CIA, and a master 6502 CPU and buffer as well. The
	  ports were connected with 8 pin DIN connectors on the card bracket,
	  for which 8 pin to DB25 adapters were supplied. The card also had
	  jumpers internally to toggle various pinning configurations.

	  This driver can be built as a module; but then "generic_serial"
	  will also be built as a module. This has to be loaded before
	  "ser_a2232". If you want to do this, answer M here.

config SX
	tristate "Specialix SX (and SI) card support"
	depends on SERIAL_NONSTANDARD && (PCI || EISA || ISA) && BROKEN
	help
	  This is a driver for the SX and SI multiport serial cards.
	  Please read the file <file:Documentation/serial/sx.txt> for details.

	  This driver can only be built as a module ( = code which can be
	  inserted in and removed from the running kernel whenever you want).
	  The module will be called sx. If you want to do that, say M here.

config RIO
	tristate "Specialix RIO system support"
	depends on SERIAL_NONSTANDARD && BROKEN
	help
	  This is a driver for the Specialix RIO, a smart serial card which
	  drives an outboard box that can support up to 128 ports.  Product
	  information is at <http://www.perle.com/support/documentation.html#multiport>.
	  There are both ISA and PCI versions.

config RIO_OLDPCI
	bool "Support really old RIO/PCI cards"
	depends on RIO
	help
	  Older RIO PCI cards need some initialization-time configuration to
	  determine the IRQ and some control addresses.  If you have a RIO and
	  this doesn't seem to work, try setting this to Y.
