This is an obsolete driver for some the CS5535 and CS5536 southbridge GPIOs.
It has been replaced by a driver that makes use of the Linux GPIO subsystem.
Please switch to that driver, and let dilinger@queued.net know if there's
anything missing from the new driver.

This driver is scheduled for removal in 2.6.40.
